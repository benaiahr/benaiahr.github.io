		<h3>Reflections on 2019</h3>
		<h3>31.12.2019</h3>
		<p class="article">Happy New Year! It's been a long time since I wrote something again, and I have nothing to do in the office (procrastinating)
		so I'm using this time to write about 2019.
		<br>
		Just today, I was reading a thread about listing out the goods and the bads of 2019. I thought it'll be cool to do
		it here.
		<br>
		So here's a short reflection list and some goals for next year.
		<br>
		</p>
			<b>Good:</b>
			<ul class="article">
				<li>Accepted into and started uni, decent grades for first sem</li>
				<li>Moved onto adults group in church</li>
				<li>First full year of working full-time and doing fairly well at work</li>
				<li>Got decent bonus and savings</li>
				<li>Mentally positive and physically healthy</li>
				<li>Hit 100kg DL</li>
				<li>Improved family relationships</li>
				<li>New side hustles and improved drive to do more</li>
				<li>Reconnected with old friends</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Bad:</b>
			<ul class="article">
				<li>Spiritually not as good as it used to, struggle with bad habits</li>
				<li>Been super busy and insufficient time to do everything I want to do</li>
				<li>Grandma is still in care home, didn't visit as often, didn't bring her to church</li>
				<li>Uncle is in jail for drug use (!!!)</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Things to continue doing in 2020</b>
			<ul class="article">
				<li>Being generous</li>
				<li>Positivity</li>
				<li>Social life and rekindling past friendships</li>
			</ul>
			<b>New goals for 2020:</b>
			<ul class="article">
				<li>Do 3 sticker runs!</li>
				<li>160kg DL</li>
				<li>Maintain grades, 2nd upper!</li>
				<li>New job</li>
				<li>Write at least 1 post a month</li>
				<li>Plan my schedule better with my planner [No double bookings, habit to follow things through]</li>
			</ul>
		<p class="article">There's probably more things to add but that's about all I care to do right now! Something I learned about goals awhile
		back is that they have to be achievable, quantifiable and time-specific. I hope this will help future-me in reflection
		and remind me to do all these things. See you next month, let's hope I don't forget this instantly after I publish!</p>

		<h3>Stephan</h3>
		<h3>24.12.2018</h3>
		<p class="article">hey dude, was really saddened by the news, even though we're not that close. I'm going to stop looking for answers
		to what happened, but I want to tell you, that you've made an impact in someone's life. I remember when you would ask
		me to tutor you in networking modules or eating lunch at midview. That day I was doing quiet time, I read through 
		Acts 6-7. The passage goes through a righteous man called Stephen and how he was ostracized and eventually stoned
		to death. It's a crazy coincidence that I think could be God's assurance for your salvation and that He's in control.
		Whatever He gives, He can take also, and I will learn to trust Him through that. Merry Christmas to you, Stephan.</p>
