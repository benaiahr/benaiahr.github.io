		<h3>Stephan</h3>
		<h3>24.12.2018</h3>
		<p>hey dude, was really saddened by the news, even though we're not that close. I'm going to stop looking for answers
		to what happened, but I want to tell you, that you've made an impact in someone's life. I remember when you would ask
		me to tutor you in networking modules or eating lunch at midview. That day I was doing quiet time, I read through 
		Acts 6-7. The passage goes through a righteous man called Stephen and how he was ostracized and eventually stoned
		to death. It's a crazy coincidence that I think could be God's assurance for your salvation and that He's in control.
		Whatever He gives, He can take also, and I will learn to trust Him through that. Merry Christmas to you, Stephan.</p>
